fi

# Loop through the file and resolve each domain name
while IFS= read -r domain; do
    if [ -n "$domain" ]; then
        # Resolve the domain to an IP address
        ip=$(dig +short "$domain" | tail -n 1)
        if [ -n "$ip" ]; then
            echo "$domain resolved to $ip"
        else
            echo "$domain could not be resolved"
        fi
    fi
